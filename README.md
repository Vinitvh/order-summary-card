## My process

### Built with

- Flexbox
- Sass
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

In this project I have used Saas. I have learnt to write mixins. Wrote media queries for major screen widths.

```css
@mixin button($theme) {
  ...;
}
```

### Continued development

Make this design more responsive and tidy.

### Useful resources

- [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Flexible_Box_Layout/Basic_Concepts_of_Flexbox#alignment_justification_and_distribution_of_free_space_between_items) - This helped me in learning Flexbox.
- [sass](https://sass-lang.com/guide) - Their official documentation is sufficient to understand sass.
